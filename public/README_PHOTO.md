# Adding Your Photo

To add your actual photo to the FIFA player card:

1. Save your photo as `madhur-photo.jpg` in this folder
2. The photo should be:
   - High resolution (at least 300x400 pixels)
   - Professional headshot style
   - Good lighting and clear visibility
   - JPG or PNG format

3. The photo will automatically be used in the player card

## Current Setup

The card currently uses a placeholder image that matches the office aesthetic. Once you add your photo, it will replace the placeholder and maintain the same styling and effects.
